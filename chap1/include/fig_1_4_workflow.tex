  \caption{Workflow to calculate the dielectric function. (a) In the anharmonic phonon method, the anharmonic phonon property is calculated from the DFT calculation of the crystal, from which the dielectric function is calculated according to the linear response theory. (b) In the molecular dynamics method, the trajectory is first obtained using molecular dynamics simulations and the dipole moment is calculated at each step. The dielectric function is calculated according the to linear response theory.}
