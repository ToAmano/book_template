  \caption{The illustration of the lattice system considered in this section. The blue circles represent atoms, and each square represents a unit cell. Therefore, we have two atoms in the unit cell (the red square). The blue part constitutes a $2\times 2$ supercell, which is connected by periodic boundary conditions. We use $\kappa$, $l$, $\mu$ for the indices of the atoms, unitcells, and Cartesian coordinates, respectively.}
